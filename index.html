<h2>How the Web Works</h2>
<p>The web is a series of discrete systems or components that work together. They include:   
</p>

<b>User + Browser</b>

<p>A user on a computer or similar device, uses a browser, 
  or similar application to make requests to servers. 
  Browsers include <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, etc.
</p>

<b>Internet</b>

<p>The internet is the communication platform that transmits requests from users to servers. 
  When requesting a web page a browser uses HTTP 
  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a>).
</p>

<b>Servers</b>

<p>Servers are specialised computers, optimized to deliver content and/or responses based on user requests.
</p>

<b>How it all works</b>

<p>When the user, in their browser tries to open a webpage, 
  a HTTP request is sent from the computer, over the internet, to the correct server that is storing that web page. 
  The server find the correct HTML document for the requested web page and returns it back, over HTTP to the users computer, 
  where it is rendered by the browser.
</p>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em></a> 
</p>

<p>Most of the content on the web is made up from HTML. HTML documents contain:</p>

<p><b>Text content:</b> The text you see (this text for example:)). <b>Remember all white space without markup turns into 1 single space!</b>
</p>

<p><b>Markup:</b> The formating or, how things are displayed.  
</p>

<p><b>References to other Docs:</b> Other HTML Docs, etc.  
</p>

<p><b>Links:</b> Nuff' said.  
</p>

<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
<p>Tags implement markup in HTML. <br>
  An element is a component of a HTML Doc, usually having a opening and a closing tag.<br>
  <!-- Found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6817262/how-to-display-html-tags-as-plain-text -->
  A opening tag is like &lt;p&gt;.<br>
  A closing tag is like &lt;/p&gt;.<br>
  A note in the img tag; the alt attribute is not required to be populted, but can be useful for SEO, 
  blind people, etc. This is an example of a VOID element - it has no closing tag.
  <p><b>If the closing tag is omitted (but required), the change implemented by the opening tag is continued to the end of the
  document/until another matching close is found. This can have unexpected effects.</b>
  </p>
</p>

<h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
<p>HTML elements can be either <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elemente"><b>inline</b></a>
  or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements"><b>block</b></a>.<br>
  Block elements have a container, or an "invisible box". Inline are only in the line the tags are in. <br>
  &lt;br&gt; is an inline tag, along with span. 
   &lt;p&gt; is block, along with div.
</p>

<h2>Things to be aware of when coding</h2>

<p><b>Computers are stupid:</b> They will try to interpret whatever is given to them, exactly as it is presented.
  So a typo can have dramatic effects.
</p>

<p><b>Don't try to remember everything:</b> Concentrate on the concepts. A Google can always be used to find the syntax
</p>

<p><b>Learn the vocab:</b> So you know what people are talking about
</p>
